# The Hifz App

A private web application for tracking Quran Hifz (memorisation). Students log their daily tasks — Dawr, Sabaq, and Sabaq Para — and their Ustadh reviews and scores each submission.

---

## Features

### Students
- **Date-aware task submission** — pick the date before logging (submit the night before for the following day)
- **Dawr** — log full-Juz revision; select Juz and quarter (1/4 · 2/4 · 3/4 · 4/4); add multiple Juz per session
- **Sabaq** — log new memorisation with Surah, starting verse, and line count
- **Sabaq Para** — log a 10-page para review with starting page number
- **Dawr Log** — 30 Juz × 4 quarter grid; re-reading the same cell on a new date adds a second cycle row instead of overwriting the first
- **SP & Sabaq Log** — view scored history with colour-coded marks
- **History** — cross-class timeline of all past tasks and Ustadh scores

### Ustadhs
- **Class management** — create classes, generate invite links, manage enrolments
- **Student review** — score each student's Dawr cycles (and specific historical cycles), Sabaq, Sabaq Para, Tajwīd, and Adab on a 1–7 scale
- **Hifz History** — per-student breakdown of all submissions including lines memorised
- **Today view** — see which students have submitted tasks for the current day

### General
- Sign in with Google — no passwords
- Progressive Web App (PWA) — installable on mobile and desktop
- Dark UI with Amiri Arabic calligraphy accents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials — [create here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

### 1 — Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run once at the repo root. npm workspaces hoist everything automatically.

### 2 — Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example server/.env
```

Edit `server/.env`:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Long random string — keep secret in production |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | From Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` | `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback` (dev) |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:5173` (dev) |
| `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS` | Optional. Gmail + App Password for account-deletion OTP. Leave blank to print codes to the server console. |

In Google Cloud Console, add `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback` as an **Authorised redirect URI**.

### 3 — Run in development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend on :3001
npm run dev --workspace=server

# Terminal 2 — frontend on :5173
npm run dev --workspace=client
```

Vite proxies all `/api/*` requests to `http://127.0.0.1:3001` in development.

---

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build --workspace=client   # outputs to client/dist/
npm run build --workspace=server   # outputs to dist/
npm run start --workspace=server
```

Serve `client/dist` via a CDN or static host, set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to that URL, and point your domain at the backend.

---

## User Roles

| Role | How to assign |
|---|---|
| **Student** | Default role after Google sign-in |
| **Ustadh** | Set manually: `UPDATE users SET role = 'ustadh' WHERE email = 'you@example.com'` |

Students who access the Hifz module are redirected to their class list first; they cannot access the module without joining a class.

---

## Database

SQLite is created automatically at `server/nazirah.db` on first run. Migrations execute on every startup — no manual steps required.

**Core tables**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts (Google sub, name, email, role) |
| `classes` | Classes owned by an Ustadh |
| `enrolments` | Student ↔ class membership |
| `class_invitations` | Invite tokens with expiry |
| `hifz_daily_tasks` | Student task submissions (Dawr, Sabaq, SP) |
| `hifz_task_scores` | Ustadh scores per date (SP, Sabaq, Tajwīd, Adab) |
| `hifz_dawr_log` | Dawr grid cells — one row per (student, class, juz, quarter, date) |

---
